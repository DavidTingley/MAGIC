Wishbone 
--------

Wishbone is an algorithm to align single cells from differentiation systems with bifurcating branches. Wishbone has been designed to work 
with multidimensional single cell data from diverse technologies such as Mass cytometry and single cell RNA-seq. 

Wishbone has been implemented in Python3 and can be installed using

`pip3 install git+https://github.com/manusetty/phenograph.git`

Wishbone usage and visualization details for single cell RNA-seq data can be found in this notebook:
